In these times of isolation, many of us are finding that we're spending more time cooking at home.

For the more adventurous among us, we may also find that we're experimenting a little bit more in the kitchen.

Want a way to keep track of all your experiments?


I propose a recipe logger


It will consist of individual user accounts.

Each user will be able to enter in the following:

	Name of Ingredient
	Unit of measurement
	Amount
	Procedure

This information will be stored using several tables. 'Ingredients' will contain information about
all types of possible ingredients (id, name). 'Units' will contain all of our different units of measurement (id, unit_name). 
'Users	' will contain information about the specific user (id, username, password). 'Recipes' will act as a bridge table between 'Ingredients'
and 'Units', will contain information about the user, and will be where the quantity of each ingredient is stored (recipeId, userId, IngredientId, UnitId, ingredientQuantity).
'userRecipe' will store which recipes belong to which user, any notes or annotations about each recipe,
as well as the date and time the recipe was posted. Importantly, it will also be where the recipe's procedure is
stored. (userId, recipeId, procedure, notes, timePosted).

I'd like to give users the ability to search for existing ingredients and add any that don't already exist. Units of measurement will be
hard-coded for convenience.

Users will have a main page with a list of their existing recipes. They can open each of them in a separate page to view. Once they're viewing, they
will be given options to add, modify, or delete anything about the recipe. Additionally, these changes will be logged. I hope to allow the user
to view all past iterations of any given recipe over time.


**userRecipe was eliminated and incorporated into 'recipes'**
**added recipeIngredient table for adding multiple ingredients**
